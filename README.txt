pum_account
-----------
This Drupal module creates user roles in Drupal for PUM Netherlands Senior Experts.
Also when creating an expert or customer account it automatically assigns a user role when creating the account.

Be aware that this module automatically sets the account to active, so it overrules when the account registration setting is set to 'Visitors, but administrator approval is required'.
